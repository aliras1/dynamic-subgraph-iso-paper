\chapter{Implementation}

All algorithms were written in Python. To evaluate the correctness of our work, two already 
existing induced subgraph isomorphism implementations were used: networkx's (Python graph 
library) isomorphism module and boost c++ library's vf2\_subgraph\_iso\ module. Both modules
implement VF2.

\section{DAF}

While implementing DAF, we chose the candidate-size matching order because it was the faster
option to evaluate.
