\chapter{Implementation}

All algorithms were written in Python. Although Python is not necessarily the right tool 
for implementing high performance algorithms, the main goal of this work was to verify if
we can make significant improvements compared to running VF2++/DAF from scratch by computing
mappings incrementally. To evaluate the correctness of our work, two already existing induced 
subgraph isomorphism implementations were used: networkx's (Python graph library) isomorphism 
module and boost c++ library's vf2\_subgraph\_iso\ module. Both modules implement VF2. We 
tried to compare the performance against the original VF2++ implementation (https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/log/lemon/lemon/vf2pp.h?rev=1433)
however it did not produce the same results as the selected baseline implementations. We also
wanted to compare our results to the original DAF implementation, however no sources for the
project were available at time of writing, only a set of pre-compiled binaries (https://github.com/SNUCSE-CTA/DAF)
which we did not want to run in the end.
