\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduced a novel incremental algorithm for finding induced subgraph isomorphisms in large dynamic graphs.
The algorithm can be used in cases when there are frequent changes to the data graph. We implemented a version based on VF2++ 
and DAF. In these use-cases the proposed procedure based of VF2++ out-performs any induced subgraph isomorphism solution run 
from scratch.
