\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduced a novel incremental algorithm for finding induced subgraph isomorphisms in large dynamic graphs.
The algorithm can be used in cases when there are frequent changes to the data graph. In these use-cases the proposed procedure
out-performs any induced subgraph isomorphism solution run from scratch.
