\chapter{Future work}

We implemented our algorithms in Python to verify that our approach could work in reality. As stated earlier,
Python in itself is not suited for high performance algorithms. Future works can include implementing these
incremental algorithms in a language which allow more fine-tuned memory handling, e.g. C++.

Since both VF2++ and DAF work on tree structures, both algorithms can be naturally implemented paralelly. This
also aplies for our modified incremental algorithm. Future research can involve parallelizing these algorithms.

Another area of future work would be using neural networks for detecting isomorphisms in large graphs. The use 
cases may not fully align with out current work, because statistical approaches can not guarantee to find all
subgraph ismorphisms. However the performance gain might out-weight the issue of missing mappings.
